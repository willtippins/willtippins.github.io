                <div>
                    This website catalogues different common databases and lists any potentially insecure default settings for those databases. This may include default passwords, user settings, and other configuration settings that can be easily changed by an administrator. Be mindful that this is a collection of security checklists, and as such can never be comprehensive.

                <h2> MISSION STATEMENT </h2> 
                <div>
                    Data science is an important part of the Vanderbilt Computer Science department. Many students use open-source tools such as MySQL to create databases for their personal and academic projects. In many cases, these projects have humble beginnings in a class or at a hackathon, and configuring security settings is an afterthought. This website should serve as a reference for setting up a database securely, or reconfiguring a previously insecure database.
